This is a project I am taking on to reacquaint myself with Java and the Java
ecosystem as well as practice some basic game design and multi-threaded
programming.

This project uses the following libraries and frameworks:
    * Maven - for managing builds, external dependencies, and file layout
    * Google Guice - for dependency injection
    * JUnit - for automated tests
    * Mockito - for mocking objects for unit tests
    * Cobertura - for generating test code coverage statistics
